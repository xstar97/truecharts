## Migrating Sqlite to Postgres(CNPG)

Create a temp sidecar as below and add `targetSelectAll: true` to the config storage to allow the sidecar to access the data to read the db and migrate the data.

Check the logs for the container and verify the postgres data was populated, you can install another chart `pgadmin` to validate the database if needed. You can remove the `migrate` sidecar, `migrateImage` and `targetSelectAll: true` after confirming the data is migrated.

```yaml
    migrateImage:
      repository: ghcr.io/ralgar/pgloader
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      tag: pr-1531@sha256:e5ae0b8149058828938d0f14ccc1f793171db8c4c8b69b7b6b45dfd998f0149f

    workload:
      main:
        podSpec:
          containers:
            # main:
            migrate:
              enabled: true
              imageSelector: migrateImage
              probes:
                liveness:
                enabled: false
                readiness:
                enabled: false
                startup:
                enabled: false
              args: 
                - pgloader
                - --with
                - "quote identifiers"
                - --with 
                - "data only"
                - /app/config/db.sqlite3
                - "{{ .Values.cnpg.main.creds.std }}"

    persistence:
